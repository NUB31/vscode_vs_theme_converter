# Visual Studio Code To Visual Studio Theme Converter

## Q/A
* ### What is this? 
As the title might suggest, this is a tool for converting a VScode json file, to a Visual Studio pkgdef file. Returns a executable that will install the theme and update the Visual Studio configuration.
The project is based on <a target='blank' href='https://github.com/microsoft/theme-converter-for-vs'>this tool</a> released by micrsoft. 
The website frontend will take a json file, and convert it to pkgdef using the MS tool. It will then be put in another prject which will install the theme.

* ### How can i use this?
The tool is hosted on <a target='blank' href='https://themeconverter.ollebolle.xyz'>themeconverter.ollebolle.xyz</a>, or you can use the docker compose file in the root of the project to host it yourself
